			<h3>The Internet</h3>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p> 
				The Internet is a collection of computers that talk to each other. The web is a collection of
		  		HTML docs.  When a user clicks on a link, that link is essentially an address to an HTML file on a server.
		  		The browser translates that HTML file into a webpage that the user sees.  HTTP is the main protocol of the web.  HTML stands for Hypetext Markup Language.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="stage-0-2">
			<h3>Tags</h3>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>	
				Tags are instructions to the computer and are not seen outside of the code <em> (e.g. on the webpage).</em> Elements are the complete tag, so from opening to closing.  These are also the "markup". Some tags need to be closed, if these types of tags are not closed, then the tag will apply to all text following the opening of the tag.Other tags do not need to be closed, these are called "Void Tags".  Tags can also have attributes.  These attributes give more dimension to a tag, such as linking a webpage to text.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="stage-0-3">
			<h3>Whitespace in HTML</h3>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>
				Whitespace in HTML doesn't translate 1:1 on the webpage.  Spaces seem to be 1:1, but multiple spaces or carrige returns do not.  For example,
		  		this is what 10 spaces looks like "          ". 
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="stage-0-4">
			<h3>Inline and Block</h3>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>
				There are inline and block elements.  Block elements seem to protect their contents by fencing them, like the paragraph element.
				Block elements are displayed with a line break while inline elements are not. All elements are rendered as boxes, and only some block elements can be container elements for other block elements. For instance, a &lt;div&gt; can have a &lt;p&gt;, an &lt;ol&gt;, a &lt;ul&gt;, another &lt;div&gt;, but an &lt;ol&gt; or &lt;ul&gt; cannot have a &lt;p&gt; or a &lt;br&gt;.
			</p>
		</div>

			<h3>Troy's Thoughts</h3>
		</div>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>	Hey look, I'm already writing in HTML!<br></li>
	  			<li>	Computers take code literally and want it to be in an exact format.  One sintax mistake and it's not going to do what you thought you told it to do.<br></li>
	  			<li>	You can't know everything about coding or a particular language; that's why we have <a href="www.google.com"> this </a></li>
			</ul>
		</div>

	<h2 id="stage-1">Stage 1: Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h2>
	<div class="lesson">
		<div id="stage-1-1">
			<h3>Languages of a Webpage</h3>
		</div>
		<div>
				Web pages can can be made up of HTML, CSS and Javascript, which are each a language.  A good way to think of these is to think of a house:<br>
				<ul>
					<li>HTML is like the walls of a house.  it is essentially the "structure" or building material.</li>
					<li>CSS is like the decor - what the house looks like.  Think paint on the walls, art, colors used, size and proportion of the furniture.</li>
					<li>Javascript is like the interactive elements of the house. Think - light switches, doors..</li>
				</ul>
		</div>
		<div id="stage-1-2">
			<h3>HTML's "tree-like" Structure</h3>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>
				This is exactly what it sounds like.  You can essentially draw out a web page as a tree; meaning a "div" can branch into a "header" and a "paragraph".  Each of those branches can branch even further depending on what is nested inside of them.  Elements define what the branches are and these are nested in other elements.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="stage-1-3">
			<h3>Speaking of Structure</h3>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>
				If you look at the HTML code of a web page the structure looks like a wave or zigzags.  This kind of structure helps when reading the code to see where sections start and end.  While some editors seem to gently create this structure while you are writing the code, it is not a given.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="stage-1-4">
			<h3>Text Editors</h3>
		</div>
		<div>	
				<ol type= "I">
					<li>Scratchpad.io <a href="scratchpad.io">LINK</a>
						<ul>
							<li>Good for Beginners</li>
							<li>Feedback is immediate</li>
							<li>No sharing</li>
							<li>Supports HTML and CSS</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Codepen <a href="codepen.io">LINK</a>
						<ul>
							<li>Intermediate level editor</li>
							<li>Feedback takes 2-3 seconds</li>
							<li>Sharing is easy but you need an account</li>
							<li>Suports HTML,CSS and Javascript</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Sublime
						<ul>
							<li>Requires some experience and getting use to
							<li>To see code updates you have to save the file and refresh the page
							<li>Sharing is possible but more difficult than Codepen
							<li>Supports alot of languages
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>
		</div>
		<div id="stage-1-5">
			<h3>CSS - Adding Style to the Structure</h3>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>
				CSS allows you to give your webpage style.  This is a separate file that the browser will read and link to the HTML file.
				Throughout the code you have many different "blocks", you can assign these blocks classes and use the CSS file to give that class a unique style.  This is helpful because this allows you to set a style easily for different blocks, without having to repeat the style setup each time.
			</p>
			<p>
				There is definately a <em><b>LOT</b></em> more to learn about CSS.  It is clear from the last segment that CSS is a powerful tool and will take time to learn (most likely from playing and failing) <img src="http://i.imgur.com/uZfdhRl.gif" width="30" height="30" alt="Oops, does not compute!">
			</p>
			<div>
				Things to note about CSS
				<ul>
					<li>CSS = Cascading Stylesheets</li>
					<li>You can also define your styles in the html file itself by adding &lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt; in the head section.</li>
					<li>If the section in CSS starts with a "." then it is defining a Class.</li>
					<li>If the selector is a tag without the brackets (i.e. "em" instead of &lt;em&gt;), then it is defining the style of that tag.
					<li>Things that can be inherited: color, font, letter spacing, line height, list style, text alignment, text indentation, text transform, visibility, white space and word spacing (probably others?)</li>
					<li>Things that are not inherited: background, border, display, float and clear, height and width, margin, min/max height & width, outline, overflow, padding, position, text decoration, vertical alignment and z index (probably others?)</li>
					<li>"The Box Model" - Margin -> Border -> Padding -> Content</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
				
				<p>Older browsers don't always like CSS, so add this to the beginning of the CSS file:<br>
				</p>
				
				<div class="codeex">
					* { <br>
	   					-webkit-box-sizing: border-box;<br>
	   					-moz-box-sizing: border-box;<br>
	   					-ms-box-sizing: border-box;<br>
	    				box-sizing: border-box;<br>
					}<br>
				</div>
